# [WIP] Anvil of Hephaestus

**Anvil of Hephaestus** is a disposable payload generator for ransomware. The payloads created infect a single machine and self-destruct in the process. This project is a simplified version of [Graverobber](https://github.com/rf-peixoto/Graverobber/) and is in an early testing phase. The generated payloads currently require manual tuning and may not yet be fully functional.
